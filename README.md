## BlackJack - Troy Zada

This project provides all the code and images used to play BlackJack. The game ends once the user loses all their money or when they physically choose to cash out. 

The game was originally created such that the user can play through the console (only backend concepts were implemented), but has now been updated with a GUI to play the game much easier.

# Frontend:
- Tkinter used as GUI of game

# Backend:
- Python used for overall code

# How It Works:
The user is able to click a "PLAY" button that will start them off with $1,000 and they can then play BlackJack. There are instructions, a cash out button, as well as the typical "DEAL", "STAND", and "HIT" buttons.

The user can play through the game for as long as they would like, as there are no actual cash limitations; the game is just a fun simulation of BlackJack.
